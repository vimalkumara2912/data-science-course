## SIMPLE LINEAR AND MULTIPLE LINEAR REGRESSION ASSIGNMENT

### Problem Statement:

This assignment focuses on understanding and applying Simple Linear Regression and Multiple Linear Regression to predict outcomes based on given datasets. By exploring the datasets, students will learn how to build regression models, evaluate their performance, and interpret their coefficients to derive meaningful insights.

### Guidelines:

1. Foundational Knowledge:
- Understand the concepts of Simple and Multiple Linear Regression.  
- Learn how to estimate the relationship between independent and dependent variables using linear models.  
- Recognize the assumptions and limitations of Linear Regression.  
- Differentiate between Simple and Multiple Linear Regression.

2. Data Exploration:
- Analyze the dataset's structure and characteristics using techniques such as scatter plots, box plots, pair plots, and correlation matrices.  
- Identify relationships between variables and assess their suitability for regression modeling.

3. Preprocessing and Feature Engineering:
- Handle missing values, outliers, and categorical variables appropriately.  
- Scale or normalize features if necessary.  
- Split the dataset into training and testing sets.  

4. Model Construction:
- Choose an appropriate implementation for Simple and Multiple Linear Regression.  
- Train a Simple Linear Regression model using one independent variable.  
- Train a Multiple Linear Regression model using multiple independent variables.  
- Interpret the coefficients of the regression models.

5. Model Evaluation:
- Evaluate the trained models using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), R-squared (R²), and Adjusted R-squared (Adjusted R²).  
- Assess how well the models fit the data and explain any discrepancies.  

6. Model Optimization and Insights:
- Analyze the residuals to ensure the assumptions of Linear Regression are met.  
- Compare the performance of Simple Linear Regression and Multiple Linear Regression models.  
- Draw conclusions based on the coefficients, p-values, and R-squared values.

### Step-by-Step Approach to Linear Regression Modeling:

1. Setup and Data Preparation:
- Import necessary libraries such as `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and `scikit-learn`.  
- Load the dataset for regression analysis.  
- Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset.  
- Preprocess the data by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing/standardizing features if needed.  

2. Simple Linear Regression:
- Select one independent variable (predictor) and one dependent variable (response).  
- Train a Simple Linear Regression model using the selected variables.  
- Visualize the regression line on a scatter plot to show the relationship between the predictor and response variable.  

3. Multiple Linear Regression:
- Select multiple independent variables (predictors) and one dependent variable (response).  
- Train a Multiple Linear Regression model using the selected features.  
- Analyze the regression coefficients to understand the impact of each predictor on the response variable.  

4. Model Evaluation:
- Calculate evaluation metrics for both Simple and Multiple Linear Regression models:  
  - Mean Squared Error (MSE)  
  - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)  
  - R-squared (R²)  
  - Adjusted R-squared (Adjusted R²)  
- Compare the performance of both models and justify the results.

5. Residual Analysis:
- Perform residual analysis to validate the assumptions of Linear Regression:  
  - Linearity  
  - Homoscedasticity (constant variance)  
  - Independence of errors  
  - Normality of residuals  

6. Model Optimization:
- Identify and remove irrelevant or highly correlated predictors to improve the model's performance.  
- Assess the impact of feature selection on the R-squared and Adjusted R-squared values.
